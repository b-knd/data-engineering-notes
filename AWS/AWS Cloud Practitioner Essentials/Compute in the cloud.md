# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
**Overview**
- Use secure, resizable compute capacity
- Boot server instances in minutes
- Pay what you use

**How it works**
1. Lauch an instance
2. Connect to instance
3. Use instance

# Amazon EC2 Instance Types
- General purpose
  - Balances compute, memory and networking resources
  - Suitable for **broad range** of workloads
- Compute optimised
  - High performance processors
  - Ideal for **compute-intensive applications and batch processing workloads**
- Memory optimised
  - Fast performance for memory-intensive workloads
  - Suitable for high performance **databases**
- Accelerated computing
  - Hardware accelerators to expedite data processing
  - Ideal for application streaming and **graphic workloads**
- Storage optimised
  - Offer low latency and high I/O operations per second (IOPS)
  - Suitable for **distributed file systems and data warehousing applications**
 
# Amazon EC2 Pricing
- On-demand
  - No upfont costs or minimum contracts
  - Ideal for **short-term, irregular workloads**
- Spot
  - Ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times
  - Offers savings over On-Demand prices
  - For workloads that is **interruptable**
- Reserved
  - Provides billing discount over On-Demand pricing
  - Require **1/3 year term commitment**
  - Specific to instances
- Compute Savings Plan
  - 66% savings over On-Demand costs for consistent amount of compute usage
  - Require 1/3 year term commitment
- Dedicated instance
  - Instance runs in VPC on hardware for single client
  - Higher cost compared to standard EC2 instance
- Dedicated host
  - Physical server with EC2 instance capacity for single customer
  - Most expensive options
