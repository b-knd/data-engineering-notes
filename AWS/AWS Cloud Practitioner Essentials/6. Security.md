# Shared responsibility model
- Division of responsibility
  - Customer (Security in the cloud)
    - Customer data, platform, applications, identity and access management, operating systems, network and firewall configuration, client-side data encryption, server-side encryption, network traffic protection
    - 
  - AWS (Security of the cloud)
    - Software, compute, storage, database, networking, hardware/AWS global infrastructure, regions, availibity zones and edge locations

# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Allows you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely
- Fleixiblity to configure access through features
  - IAM users, groups and roles
  - IAM policies
  - Multi-factor authentication

**AWS account root user**
- Steps:
  - Create AWS account which establishes root user identity
  - Create first IAM user and give permission to create other users
- Access root user by signing with email address and password for AWS account
- Advise against conducting everyday tasks using root user account, create IAM users and assign permission to do tasks

**IAM users**
- Identity that represent person or application that interacts with AWS services and resources, consist of name and credentials
- Default is no permission, need to grant manually

**IAM policy**
- Document that allows or denies permissions to AWS services and resources
- Allows you to customize users level of access to resources
- Follow principle ot least privilege when granting permissions

**IAM groups**
- Collection of IAM users
- IAM policy assigned to group can assign to all user in group

**IAM roles**
- Identity you can assume to gain temporary access to permissions
- Users must be granted permissions to switch to the role
- Users assume role will abandon all previous permissions that had under previous role

# AWS Organizations
- Consilodate and manage multiple AWS accounts within central location
- Organisation automatically creates root when organisation is created, which is the parent container for all accounts in organisation
- Use service control policies (SCPs) to control permissions for account
  - helps you place restrictions on AWS servies, resources and individual API actions that users and roles in each account can access
  - Can apply SCPs to the root

**Organizational units**
- To manage accounts with similar business or security requirements
- Can still provide access for users, groups, and roles through IAM

**Multi-factor authentication**
- Extra layer ot security for AWS account
- Can be enabled for root users and IAM users

# Compliance
**AWS Artifact**
- Service that provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements
- Two main sections
  - AWS Artifact Agreements
    - Review, accept and manage agreements for an individual account and all accounts in AWS Organizations
  - AWS Artifact reports
    - Provide compliance reports from third-party auditors
    - Can provide AWS audit artifacts to auditors or regulators as evidence of AWS security controls

**Customer Compliance Center**
- Contains resources to learn more about AWS compliance
- Include auditor learning path

# AWS WAF
- Web application firewall that protect web applciations or APIs against common web exploits
- Control how traffic reaches appliations
- Create security rules that:
  - Block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting
  - Filter out specific traffic patterns that you define
- Application layer protection
  - WAF provides real-time metrics and capture raw requests that include details about IP addresses and geolocations
- CloudFront integration
  - Rules run in all AWS edge locations so security don't impact perfromance
  - When WAF used on Application Load Balancer, rules run in Region and can be used to protect internet-facing and internal load balancers
- Rules
  - Statement with condition about inspection criteria and action to take
  - Can block matching requests ot allow matching requests
  - Have managed rules (managed and curated by AWS and AWS Marketplace Sellers) or custom AWS WAF rules

**AWS Shield**
- Minimise effect of Denial of Service attack (DoS) and Distributed denial of service attach (DDoS) (One from single source another from multiple)
- Protects application against DDoS attacks
- Two level of protection: Standard and Advances
  - Standard:
    - Protects all AWS customers at no cost
    - From common, frequently occuring types of DDoS attack
    - Use analysis techniques to detect malicious traffic in real time and automatically mitgates it
  - Advances:
    - Paid service that provides detailed attack diagnostics and ability to detect and mitigate sophiticated DDoS attacks
    - ntegrate with other services such as CloudFront, Amazon Route 53 and ELB
- Can be integrated with AWS Shield by writing custom rules to mitigate complex DDoS attacks

**Amazon Inspector**
- Improve security and compliance of applications by running automated security assessments
- Checks applications and containers for security vulnerabilities and deviations from security best practices

# Additional security services
- Need to ensure data is secure while in storage (encryption at rest) and while it is transimitted (encryption in transit)

**AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)**
- Perform encryption operations through use of cryptographic keys
- Create, manage and use cryptographic keys
- Choose specific levels of access control you need for your keys (Eg. specify which IAM users and roles are able to manage keys)

**Amazon GuardDuty**
- Service that provide intelligent threat detection for AWS infrastructure and resources
- Identifies threats by continuously monitoring network activity and account behaviour within AWS environment
- Can review findings from AWS Management Console
- Can configure AWS Lambda functions to take remediation steps automatically in response to GuardDuty security findings
