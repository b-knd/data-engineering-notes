# AWS Storage
- Block storage
  - Files are separated into equal-sized pieces of data
  - Used for applications that runs on Amazon EC2 instances
  - Example
    - Instance store
      - Attach to Amazon EC2 instance
      - When instance is stopped, data written to instance store will be deleted
    - Amazon EBS volumes
      - Provides block storage to be used with instances for data that needs retention
      - To create volumn, define configuration and provision it, volume can be attached to instance
      - Back up data using Amazon EBS snapshots
        - Incremental backup
        - Only save blocks of data that have changed
- Object storage
  - Each object consist of data, metadata and key
  - Example
    - Amazon Simple Storage Service
      - Store objects in buckets
      - Set permissions to control access to objects
      - Choose from range of storage classes for different use cases
      - Amazon S3 storage classes
        - S3 Standard
          - Designed for frequently accessed data
          - Stores data in minimum of three Availability Zones
        - S3 Standard-IA
          - Ideal for infrequently accessed data
          - Similar to S3 Standard but has lower storage price and higher retrieval price
        - S3 One Zone-IA
          - Stores data in single Availability Zone
          - Lower storage price than S3 Standard-IA
        - S3 Intelligent-Tiering
          - Ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns
          - Requires small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object
        - S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
          - Low-cost storage designed for data archiving
          - Able to retrieve objects in milliseconds
        - S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
          - Lowest-cost object storage class
          - Configurable retrieval time from minutes to hours
        - S3 Glacier Deep Archive
          - Lowest-cost object storage class
          - Able to retrieve objects within 12 hours
- File storage
  - Multiple clients can access data that is stored in shared file folders
  - Example
    - Amazon Elastic File System
      - Store data in scalable file system
      - Provide data to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances concurrently
      - Store data in and across multiple Availability Zones by default
    - AWS Databases
      - Database types
        - Relational database
          - Data is stored in a way that is related to another pieces of data
          - Use SQL to store and query data
          - Amazon relational database service
            - Operate and scale relational database in AWS cloud
            - Automate time-comsuming administrative tasks
            - Store and transmit data securely
          - Amaxon RDS database engines
            - Amazon Aurora
              - Store data in enterprise-class relational database
              - Reduce database costs by eliminating unnecessary I/O operations
              - Replicate six copies of data across three Availability Zones
            - PostgreSQL
            - MySQL
            - MariaDB
            - Oracle Database
            - Microsoft SQL Server
        - Nonrelational database
          - Use structures other than rows and columns to organise data
          - With key-value pairs, data is organised into items and items have attributes (values)
          - Amazon DynamoDB
            - Severless key-value database
            - Automatically scales to adjust for capacity changes and maintain consistent performance
            - Designed to handle over 10 trillion requests per day
