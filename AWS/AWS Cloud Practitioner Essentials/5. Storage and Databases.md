# AWS Storage
- Block storage
  - Behaves like physical hard drives
  - Files are separated into equal-sized pieces of data
  - Used for applications that runs on Amazon EC2 instances
  - Data update are independant in each block
  - Example
    - Instance store
      - Temporary block-level storage attached to Amazon EC2 instance
      - When instance is stopped, data written to instance store will be deleted
    - Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes
      - Provides block storage to be used with instances for data that needs retention
      - To create volume, define configuration and provision it, volume can be attached to instance
      - Back up data using Amazon EBS snapshots
        - Incremental backup
        - Only save blocks of data that have changed
- Object storage
  - Each object consist of data (image/video/text), metadata (contextual information about what the data is, purpose or size) and key (unique identifier ot object
  - When file in object storage is modified, entire object is updated
  - Example
    - Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
      - Store objects in buckets
      - Maximum file size is 5TB
      - Set permissions to control access to objects
      - Use Amazon S3 versioning feature to track changes to object over time
      - Choose from range of storage classes for different use cases
      - Amazon S3 storage classes
        - S3 Standard
          - Designed for frequently accessed data
          - Stores data in minimum of three Availability Zones
          - Use case: websites, content distribution and data analytics
          - Highest cost in the category of infrequently accessed data and archival storage
        - S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
          - Ideal for infrequently accessed data but high availability when needed
          - Store in minimum of three Availability Zones
          - Similar to S3 Standard but has lower storage price and higher retrieval price
        - S3 One Zone-IA
          - Stores data in single Availability Zone
          - Lower storage price than S3 Standard-IA
        - S3 Intelligent-Tiering
          - Ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns
          - Requires small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object
          - Amazon S3 moves object to different access tier depending on usage pattern, automated movement
        - S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
          - Low-cost storage designed for data archiving
          - Able to retrieve objects in milliseconds
        - S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
          - Lowest-cost object storage class
          - Configurable retrieval time from minutes to hours
        - S3 Glacier Deep Archive
          - Lowest-cost object storage class
          - Able to retrieve objects within 12 hours
- File storage
  - Multiple clients can access data that is stored in shared file folders
  - Ideal for use cases which large number of services and resources must access same data simultaneously
  - Storage server use block storage with local file system to organize files, client access data through fil paths
  - Example
    - Amazon Elastic File System
      - Store data in scalable file system
      - Provide data to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances concurrently
      - Store data in and across multiple Availability Zones by default (as opposed to EBS having to be in same zone as instance and only stored within single Availability Zone)
# AWS Databases
    - Database types
      - Relational database
        - Data is stored in a way that is related to another pieces of data
        - Use SQL to store and query data
        - Amazon relational database service
          - Operate and scale relational database in AWS cloud
          - Automate time-comsuming administrative tasks
          - Store and transmit data securely
        - Amaxon RDS database engines
          - Amazon Aurora
            - Store data in enterprise-class relational database
            - Reduce database costs by eliminating unnecessary I/O operations
            - Replicate six copies of data across three Availability Zones
          - PostgreSQL
          - MySQL
          - MariaDB
          - Oracle Database
          - Microsoft SQL Server
      - Nonrelational database
        - Use structures other than rows and columns to organise data
        - With key-value pairs, data is organised into items and items have attributes (values)
        - Amazon DynamoDB
          - Severless key-value database
          - Automatically scales to adjust for capacity changes and maintain consistent performance
          - Designed to handle over 10 trillion requests per day
         
    - AWS Database Migration Service
      - Allows you to migrate relational databases, non relational databases and other types of data stores
      - Move data between source database and target database, source remains operational during migration, reducing downtime of applications
      - Other use cases:
        - Development and test database migrations: enabling developers to test applications against production data but without affecting production users
        - Database consolidation: combine several databases into single database
        - Continuous replication: sending ongoing copies data to oter target sources instead of one-time migration
- Additional database services
  - Amazon Redshift
    - Data warehousing service that you can use for big data analytics
    - Can collect data from many sources and understand data relationship and trends
  - Amazon DocumentDB
    - Document database service that supports MongoDB workloads
  - Amazon Neptune
    - Graph database service
    - To build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets (recommendation engines, fraud detection and knowledge graphs)
  - Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB)
    - Ledger (record keeping system used to track transactions, changes or events in structured and tamper-proof way) database service
  - Amazon Managed Blockchain
    - Service used to crate and manage blockhain networks with open source frameworks
    - Distributed ledger system that lets multiple parties run transactions and share data without central authority
  - Amazon ElastiCache
    - Service that adds caching layers on top of your databases to help improve the read times of common requests
    - Supports Redis/Memcached data stores
    - Review complete history of all changes made to application data
  - Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
    - in-memory cache for DynamoDB
    - Helps to improve response times from single-digit milliseconds to microseconds
