# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
**Overview**
- Use secure, resizable compute capacity
- Boot server instances in minutes
- Pay what you use

**How it works**
1. Lauch an instance
    - Choose template with basic configurations of instance
    - Configurations include operating system, application server/ application
    - Choose specific hardware configuration of instance
    - Specify security settings to control network traffic in/out of instance
2. Connect to instance
    - One option: connect by logging in and accessing computer desktop
3. Use instance

# Amazon EC2 Instance Types
- General purpose
  - Balances compute, memory and networking resources
  - Suitable for **broad range** of workloads (Eg. application servers, gaming servers, backend servers for enterprise applications, small/medium databases)
- Compute optimised
  - High performance processors
  - Ideal for **compute-intensive applications and batch processing workloads**
- Memory optimised
  - Fast performance for memory-intensive workloads
  - Suitable for high performance **databases**
- Accelerated computing
  - Hardware accelerators to expedite data processing
  - Ideal for application streaming and **graphic workloads**
  - Eg: floating point number calculations, graphic processing and data pattern matching
- Storage optimised
  - Offer low latency and high I/O operations per second (IOPS)
  - Suitable for **distributed file systems and data warehousing applications, high frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems**
 
# Amazon EC2 Pricing
- On-demand
  - No upfont costs or minimum contracts
  - Ideal for **short-term, irregular workloads**
  - Ex: developing and testing applications, running applications with unpredictable usage patterns
  - If > one year, consider Reserved Instances
- Spot
  - Ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times
  - Offers savings over On-Demand prices
  - For workloads that is **interruptable**
- Reserved
  - Provides billing discount over On-Demand pricing
  - Require **1/3 year term commitment**
  - Specific to instances
- Compute Savings Plan
  - 66% savings over On-Demand costs for consistent amount of compute usage
  - Require **1/3 year term commitment**
- Dedicated instance
  - Instance runs in **VPC on hardware for single client**
  - Higher cost compared to standard EC2 instance
- Dedicated host
  - **Physical server** with EC2 instance capacity for **single customer**
  - Most expensive options

# Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
- Scale capacity as computing requirements change, greater sense of application availability
- Options (can be used together):
    - Dynamic scaling: responds to changing demand
    - Predictive scaling: schedules right number of EC2 instances based on predicted demand
    - Using together: use predictive scaling to predict demands change, and dynamic comes in if actual demands differ from that predicted. Amazon allow the enabling of both option together

# Elastic Load Balancing
- Automatically distributes traffic across multiple resources
- Load balancer provides single point of contact for Auto Scaling Group

# AWS Messaging Services
**Amazon Simple Notification Service**
- Publish/subscribe service
- Message are published by published to subscribers that subcribe to topics
- Subscribers can be web servers, email addresses, AWS Lambda functions...

**Amazon Simple Queue Service**
- Message queueing service
- Send, store and receive messages between software components
- Queue messages without requiring other services

# Severless Compute Services
**AWS Lambda**
- Run code without provisioning or managing servers
- Pay only for compute time while code is running
- Use other AWS services to automatically trigger code
- How it works
  1. Upload code to AWS lambda
  2. Set code to trigger from event source (AWS services, mobile applications, HTTP endpoints)
  3. Code runs only when triggered
  4. Pay only for compute time

# AWS Container Services
- Containers provide standard way to package application's code and dependencies into single object
- Frequently used for processes and workflows in which there are essential requirements for security, reliability and scalability
**Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)**
- Run and scale containerised applications
- Use simple API calls to control Docker-enabled applications

**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)**
- Run and scale Kubernetes applications
- Readily update applications with new features

**AWS Fargate**
- Serverless compute engine for containers
- Run serverless containers with Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS
- Pay only for the resources you use
