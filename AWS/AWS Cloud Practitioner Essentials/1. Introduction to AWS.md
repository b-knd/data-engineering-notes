# Cloud Computing Deployment Models
### What is Cloud Computing
- Accessing service on demand
- Avoid large upfront investments
- Provision computing resources as needed
- Pay only for what you use

### Cloud Computing Deployment Models
- Cloud
  - Run application in cloud
  - Migrate existing applications to cloud
  - Design and build new applications in cloud
- On-premises (Private cloud)
  - Use virtualisation and resource management tools to deploy resources
  - Use app management and virtualisation technologies to increase resource usage
- Hybrid
  - Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure
  - Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications
 
# Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Variable expenses
  - No upfront expenses to invest in technology resources such as data centers, physical servers
  - Only pay for computing resources that is consumed
- Cost optimization
  - No effort needed to maintain or run data centers
  - More time on applications and clients
- Capacity
  - No need to predict capacity needed before deployment
  - Launch instances when needed and pay for compute time
  - Pay for needed capacity at time, scale in or out based on demands
- Economies of scale
  - Lower variable cost due to customers' aggregated usage
  - AWS achieving higher economies of scales means lower pay-as-you-go price
- Speed and agility
  - Easier to develop and deploy applications
  - Access new resource in short time (minutes)
- Global in minutes
  - Able to deploy applications globally quickly with minimal delay in global access

### AWS Core service categories
