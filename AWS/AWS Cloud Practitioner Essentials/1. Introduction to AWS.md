# Cloud Computing Deployment Models
### What is Cloud Computing
- Accessing service on demand
- Avoid large upfront investments
- Provision computing resources as needed
- Pay only for what you use

### Cloud Computing Deployment Models
- Cloud
  - Run application in cloud
  - Migrate existing applications to cloud
  - Design and build new applications in cloud
- On-premises (Private cloud)
  - Use virtualisation and resource management tools to deploy resources
  - Use app management and virtualisation technologies to increase resource usage
- Hybrid
  - Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure
  - Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications

|   | Cloud | On-Premises | Hybrid Cloud |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| **Definition**  | Fully hosted and managed on AWS infrastructure | Infrastructure managed in the organization's own data center | Mix of on-premises and AWS cloud infrastructure |
| **Infrastructure**  | All resources reside in AWS data centers | Hardware and software reside on-site| Some workloads run on AWS, others on-premises |
| **Scalability**  | Highly scalable on demand | Limited by physical capacity | Scalable based on need-cloud for scaling |
| **Cost Model**  | Pay as you go (OPEX) | High upfront costs (CAPEX) | Mix of CAPEX and OPEX |
| **Latency**  | Lower latency for cloud-native apps | Very low latency (local) | Local workloads benefit from low latency, cloud supports scaling |
| **Control**  | Limited control over physical infrastructure | Full control over infrastructure | Full control on-prmises, flexible in cloud |
| **Security**  | AWS manages physical security, user configures virtual security | Full control over physical and network security | On-premises security + AWS cloud security |
| **Reliability**  | High availability with multiple regions/zones | Depends on rendundancy built on-site  | Redundancy can be split across cloud and on-premises |
| **Use Cases**  | Startups, web apps, big data | Regulated industries needing full control | Data-sensitive apps with cloud bursting |
| **Example (AWS Services)**  | Amazon EC2, S3, Lambda | Outposts (on-site AWS hardware) | AWS Outposts, ECS Anywhere, Snowball |


# Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Variable expenses
  - No upfront expenses to invest in technology resources such as data centers, physical servers
  - Only pay for computing resources that is consumed
- Cost optimization
  - No effort needed to maintain or run data centers
  - More time on applications and clients
- Capacity
  - No need to predict capacity needed before deployment
  - Launch instances when needed and pay for compute time
  - Pay for needed capacity at time, scale in or out based on demands
- Economies of scale
  - Lower variable cost due to customers' aggregated usage
  - AWS achieving higher economies of scales means lower pay-as-you-go price
- Speed and agility
  - Easier to develop and deploy applications
  - Access new resource in short time (minutes)
- Global in minutes
  - Able to deploy applications globally quickly with minimal delay in global access

### AWS Core service categories
- Compute
- Network and content delivery
- Storage
- Database
- Security, Identity and Compliance
