# Multi-clustering Warehouses
- Concept where warehouse can allocate (statically/dynamically (auto scaling)) resources to additional clusters to make larger pool of compute resources
- Auto suspension/resumption of warehouses depending on need
- Resizing: without resizing, stuck with original warehouse size, risk of overusing or resource limitation, but with resizing, can automatically adjust warehouse size to match need (eg changeing from M to L)

## Scaling Policy
Different criteria on when to spin an additional cluster to handle workload
- Standard (Performance): favors starting additional warehouses
  - Cluster starts immediately when there are query queues
  - Shuts down after 2-3 checks (determine if workload on least loaded cluster could be redistributed to other clusters)
- Economy (Cost): favors conserving credits rather than starting additional warehouses
  - Starts only when estimation of time cluster will be kept busy by query is at least 6 minutes
  - Shuts down after 5-6 consecutive checks

# Warehouse sizing
- Power of 2 increment
- XS (1 server) -> 6XL (512 servers)
- Num of server = Credits/hour comsumption
- Cost calculated based on number of cluster used per each hour (capped by the maximum cluster allowed)
